# Sums

The program to compute the sum of a list of numbers in `code.js` is incorrect
(and the tests in `code.test.js` are failing). Correct the code such that it
passes the tests.


While the code was all my own, I did have to use https://jsverify.github.io/ to resolve
an error stating "Cannot find module 'jsverify.'" Specifically, I had to install the module
to get it to work on my machine.

otherwise. I am aware that plagiarism carries severe penalties and that if plagiarism is
